  <h2><strong>A few things about me</strong></h2>
  <p>My wife and I recently moved to Kennesaw,GA and we have a 3-year old maltipoo who is our own personal roomba and alarm system.
    During my free time, I enjoy playing games on my PC or Xbox and watching car detailing videos on Youtube. 
    I also enjoy listening to Nujabes when i'm working on anything as it does help me concentrate.<br/>
    <br/>
    While i'm working on my about me, I will include my grocery list for today. The items I need to buy are:<br/>

    <ul>
      <li>Cheese for quesadillas</li>
      <li>Cheese for sandwhices</li>
      <li>Small pack of ground beef</li>
      <li>Bottle of soy sauce</li>
      <li>Cashew milk</li>
    </ul>
    
    *Note to self, don't forget to go to the store once done with your "about me".  
    <!--yeah I totally didn't mean to leave the "note to self" visible-->
